# Twitter Sentiment Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This hands-on project focuses on performing sentiment analysis on Twitter data. The project aims to understand the sentiment behind tweets and involves various tasks, including data exploration, data cleaning, and the implementation of a Naive Bayes classifier for sentiment analysis.

## Project Structure

### Import Libraries and Datasets
Import necessary libraries and datasets for analysis and model training.

### Perform Exploratory Data Analysis
Explore the Twitter data to gain a better understanding of its structure, patterns, and characteristics.

### Plot the Word Cloud
Create a word cloud visualization to highlight frequently occurring words in the dataset.

### Perform Data Cleaning - Removing Punctuation
Clean the data by removing punctuation from the text.

### Perform Data Cleaning - Remove Stop Words
Further clean the data by removing stop words from the text.

### Perform Count Vectorization (Tokenization)
Tokenize the text data using Count Vectorization.

### Create a Pipeline to Remove Stop Words, Punctuation, and Perform Tokenization
Build a pipeline to streamline the process of data cleaning and tokenization.

### Understand the Theory and Intuition Behind Naive Bayes Classifiers
Explore the theory and intuition behind Naive Bayes classifiers, a commonly used algorithm for sentiment analysis.

### Train a Naive Bayes Classifier
Implement and train a Naive Bayes classifier using the preprocessed Twitter data.

### Assess Trained Model Performance
Evaluate the performance of the trained Naive Bayes classifier in terms of accuracy and other relevant metrics.
